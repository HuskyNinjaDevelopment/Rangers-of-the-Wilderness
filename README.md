30 JUL 23 Update

First a very special thank you to HuskyNinjaDevelopment (https://github.com/HuskyNinjaDevelopment) for adding the 'Poaching' callout and all the extra files that makes the callout function.  Definitely showing off the possibilities for making callouts function at a high level, and I hope to learn a lot from this and use it in the future.  Currently this does place the callout pack into a position of non-functioning without the removal of the 'Poaching' and 'Illegal Hunting' callouts, however this will eventually get updated to become functional.

\\ ALPHA RELEASE //

An evergrowing callout pack for FivePD and a branch of Project VRRC (https://github.com/Valandria/Project-VRRC), focused on the wilderness areas around Mount Chiliad, Mount Gordo, and Mount Josiah.  Currently there is only four callouts within the pack; A hiker being attacked, a hiker who has become stranded, a motorist who struck an animal, and some boaters who are possibly stranded in the river.

Please note: this will come with both the main callout file to run the callouts on a server with FivePD, and the dev files for individuals who wish to make adjustments or alterations to the callouts.  If you are only interested in using the callouts, simply drag the RangersoftheWilderness.net.dll file into your callout folder and you're done.

This pack is currently in its alpha state and lacks additional features and callouts that will be released eventually.

For further information regarding callout designations used in this pack, please see https://github.com/Valandria/Project-VRRC and review the readme file.
